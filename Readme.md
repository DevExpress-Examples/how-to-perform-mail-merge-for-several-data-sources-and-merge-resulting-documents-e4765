# How to perform mail merge for several data sources and merge resulting documents


<p>This example illustrates how to use the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#DocumentServer/CustomDocument15278">Mail Merge</a> functionality of the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#DocumentServer/CustomDocument15092">Word Processing File API</a> to merge data from different datasources and merge resultant documents into one in an ASP.NET application. The approach illustrated in this example is similar to one utilized in the <a href="http://demos.devexpress.com/ASPxDocumentServerDemos/RichEdit/RichEditMailMerge.aspx">Office File API - Mail Merge</a> online demo. The difference is that we use multiple datasources in our example, and all records from an associated datasource are rendered in mail-merged document previews.</p>
